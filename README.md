Task 1: Done

Task 2: Done

Task 3: Done

Task 4: Done

# Todo
1, Currently saving tag only in memory instead DB or local, so if user close the app the saved bookmark will be disappear.

2, Update asset file to OnLoop provided.

3, Currently everything is hardcode in stead configurable, later need to make it configuarable.

4, Not testd on device and different models, need to make app resonsilbe for different device.

# Preblem encountered

1, UI: Layout, overflow....

2, Data: Dependency Injection for "provider" and "get_it", final decision is "get_it" cuz it's easy to use

# Conclusion:

This solution will consume server and network resource but it's fast to develop, because for saving tags and filtering content with tag, I will recall API to retrieve all data from server, and if Data ID matching I will load them and display for user. By right, for better performance and saving server resource we need only load all data for first time then reuse it by differen model, but this will spend some time for coding it, I think I will implement it in future.

Anyway, this is a very interesting task and let me learn much from it.
